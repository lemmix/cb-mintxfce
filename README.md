# cb-mintxfce
For "crunchbanging" Linux  Mint xfce

I really liked the look of Crunchbang Linux and the menu on one site, and the philosophy of Linux Mint on the other. So I take the scripts from !# and crunchbanged my Linux Mint Xfce. 
menu.xml autostart and rc.xml are changed for my needs.
The install script does most of the steps to install all packages needed (ToDo).
